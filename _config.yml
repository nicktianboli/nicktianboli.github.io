    title: "D4FT: A Deep Learning Approach to Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory"
    author: Tianbo Li, Min Lin, Zheyuan Hu, Kunhao Zheng, Giovanni Vignale, Kenji Kawaguchi, A. H. Castro Neto, Kostya S. Novoselov, Shuicheng Yan
    venue: "ICLR 2023 (Spotlight)"

    ORlink: "https://openreview.net/forum?id=aBWnqqsuot7"
    githublink: "https://github.com/sail-sg/d4ft"
    intro: In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to KS-DFT. We propose to directly minimize the total energy by reparameterizing the orthogonal constraint as a feed-forward computation. We prove that such an approach has the same expressivity as the SCF method, yet reduces the computational complexity from O(N^4) to O(N^3).

  - name: nonparametric
    title: "Nonparametric Generative Modeling with Conditional Sliced-Wasserstein Flows"
    author: Chao Du, Tianbo Li, Tianyu Pang, Shuicheng YAN, Min Lin
    venue: ICML 2023
    path: /assets/project/nonparametric/
    ORlink: https://openreview.net/forum?id=cOngPVufCF
    intro: In this work, we make two major contributions to bridging this gap. Based on a pleasant observation that (under certain conditions) the SWF of joint distributions coincides with those of conditional distributions, we propose CSWF that enables nonparametric conditional modeling. We introduce appropriate inductive biases of images into SWF which greatly improve the efficiency and quality of modeling images.

    path: /assets/project/nif/
    ORlink: https://openreview.net/forum?id=aQuqw6eVKP
    intro: "In this work, we propose neural integral functional (NIF), which is a general functional approximator that suits a large number of scientific problems including the brachistochrone curve problem in classical physics and density functional theory in quantum physics."

    title: "Mitigating Performance Saturation in Neural Marked Point Processes: Architectures and Loss Functions"

    venue: SIGKDD 2021
    githublink: https://github.com/ltz0120/Graph-Convolutional-Hawkes-Processes-GCHP
    path: /assets/project/kdd/
    intro: This work introduces a Graph Convolutional Hawkes Process (GCHP) method incorperating marked point processes model to deal with predictions on attributed event sequences.

    title: "Tweedie-Hawkes Processes: Interpreting the Phenomena of Outbreaks"
    path: /assets/project/thp/
    author: Tianbo Li, Yiping Ke
    intro: In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model called Tweedie-Hawkes Processes (THP), which is able to model the outbreaks of events and find out the dominant factors behind. THP leverages on the Tweedie distribution in capturing various excitation effects. A variational EM algorithm is developed for model inference.

    title: Thinning for Accelerating the Learning of Point Processes
    path: /assets/project/thinning/
    author: Tianbo Li, Yiping Ke
    intro: This paper discusses one of the most fundamental issues about point processes that what is the best sampling method for point processes. We propose thinning as a downsampling method for accelerating the learning of point processes. We find that the thinning operation preserves the structure of intensity, and is able to estimate parameters with less time and without much loss of accuracy. 

  - name: transfer
    venue: ICDM 2018
    title: Transfer hawkes processes with content information
    path: /assets/project/transfer/
    author: Tianbo Li, Pengfei Wei, Yiping Ke
    intro: In this paper,we propose a novel model called transfer Hybrid Least Square for Hawkes (trHLSH) that incorporates Hawkes processes with content and cross-domain information.
